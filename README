GroovTK

Just a super ultra minimal web browser that opens grooveshark.
Nothing fancy, I'm just tired of the most famous web browsers, 
you have to reload everything once a day because something always
dies (like flash in GNU/Linux). So I wanted to have this one 
separated.

License

Everything is under GPLv2, but it's not like it's really hard code
to do. Just merge a gtk basic tutorial with the code snippet in 
WebKitWebView's documentation page and you are done.
